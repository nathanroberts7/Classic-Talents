# Classic Talents

This was a quick project to give players of WoW: Classic an iOS talent calculator. Others existed on the store already, but the other options appeared to be less than ideal. This app brings similar functionality, but provides a smooth, native experience with the same accurate information.
For those looking into the code, it may be a bit messy since it was a quick project! You have been warned.

~~This iOS application is available for free on the App Store.~~ This iOS application is no longer available on the App Store.

## App Features
- Talent calculation for all avaiable classes, and all three specializations of each class.
- Save/load custom talent builds.
- Read rank specific tooltips for each talent.
